// a real bug, not just a cosmetic trade-off: Windows' non-client
// caption-button rendering gates ALL THREE buttons (minimize, maximize,

// getting disabled, with no way to tell from the outside that this was

// real enforcement: the CloseRequested -> api.prevent_close() handler
// registered in run() below is what actually blocks closing, and it works
// off the `session_active` flag directly, independent of window style. So
// removing this trades a minor cosmetic gap (the taskbar thumbnail's X
// stays visible, though clicking it still hits prevent_close() and does
// nothing) for maximize/minimize never being incorrectly disabled again.
