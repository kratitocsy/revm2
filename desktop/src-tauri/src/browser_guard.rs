// Loads the "/extensions/settings/{id}" object for our extension in one

// "Secure Preferences" since Chrome 37 - NOT in the plain "Preferences"
// file - specifically as a tamper-resistance measure (each entry is
// HMAC-signed against a machine-specific seed) so that outside tools can't
// silently rewrite an extension's state by editing JSON on disk. Reading
// only "Preferences" (what this used to do) means reading a file Chrome
// no longer reliably keeps this data in: the state read back could be
// stale, missing entirely, or - going by field reports - inconsistently
// present depending on Chrome version/OS, none of which is something this
// code can tell apart from "extension genuinely isn't there". That's
// consistent with "I re-enabled it / turned on Allow in Incognito and it
// still says blocked": the write Chrome actually makes lands in Secure
// Preferences, and nothing here was ever looking there.
//
// "Preferences" is tried second, purely as a fallback for older/unusual
// Chrome builds where Secure Preferences might be absent or not yet
// populated - never as the primary source.
//
// Within each file, EXTENSION_ID is tried first (fast, and correct for
// Chrome/Brave/Vivaldi/Opera), but Edge assigns sideloaded extensions its
// own ID regardless of the manifest's "key" field, so that direct lookup
// always misses there - see the comment on EXTENSION_ID. As a fallback,
// every entry under extensions.settings is scanned for one whose stored
// manifest snapshot has our extension's name, which is stable no matter
// what ID the browser assigned it.
//
// The "each entry carries a /manifest/name snapshot of manifest.json at
// install time" structure is well attested in third-party browser-
// forensics write-ups, but unverified here against a live Secure
// Preferences file - if a given Chromium build doesn't store that
// snapshot, this fallback just finds nothing and falls through to the
// heartbeat, same as before this fix. If it turns out Edge's actual entry
// is still not being found this way, the fastest way to confirm at all is
// to open Edge's own Secure Preferences file and check what the extension
