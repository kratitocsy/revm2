// Native (Rust/tokio) fallback for "is a focus session active right now."
//
// THE BUG THIS FIXES: every other piece of session-state truth in this app
// - starting a schedule-driven block, ending one, keeping the close/quit
// lock alive, everything - ultimately traces back to ONE source: the
// webview page (blocks.html's loadActiveBlock, tracker.html's
// pollBlockStatusForDesktop) calling `sb.from('focus_lock_sessions')...`
// on a plain `setInterval(..., 5000)` and forwarding the answer to Rust
// via the `set_session_active` command. See lib.rs's WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SECS
// doc comment - the watchdog even admits this poll can "die."
//
// It doesn't just die from crashes. Chromium (and WebView2, which is
// Chromium under the hood on Windows) deliberately throttles - and, once
// a page has been hidden/occluded long enough, can pause almost entirely
// - JS timers like setInterval in a backgrounded frame ("Intensive Timer
// Throttling" / background tab throttling). Turning the monitor off is
// enough to make Windows treat this app's window as occluded even though
// the process itself, and the rest of the machine, is still fully awake -
// so the 5s poll can silently stretch to minutes. Two visible symptoms
// follow:
//   1. A schedule slot that's supposed to start while the screen is off
//      never gets enforced - schedule-tick (the Supabase Edge Function)
//      still creates the focus_lock_sessions row right on time, but
//      nothing here ever tells this process to start blocking, because
//      nothing called set_session_active(true).
//   2. Worse, an ALREADY active block can get released early: if the
//      poll stays quiet for WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SECS (120s) - very plausible
//      once Chromium's intensive throttling kicks in after ~5 minutes
//      hidden - spawn_watchdog_loop (lib.rs) assumes the poll died and
//      lifts enforcement itself.
//
// The fix: an independent channel that isn't a webview timer at all. This
// task runs on tokio's own scheduler, which Windows does not throttle
// just because a monitor is off (unlike a hidden browser frame), and
// talks to Supabase's REST API directly - the same query
// loadActiveBlock() makes, just made from Rust instead of JS. On a
// healthy system where the webview poll is running normally, this is a
// redundant confirmation that agrees with what set_session_active is
// already being told. It only ever matters once the JS side has gone
// quiet, which is exactly when it's needed most.
//
// This is additive, not a replacement, matching the same philosophy as
// heartbeat.rs and taskmgr_backstop.rs elsewhere in this app: give
// something that's supposed to be continuous a second, OS-level way to
// stay true instead of depending on a single fragile signal.
