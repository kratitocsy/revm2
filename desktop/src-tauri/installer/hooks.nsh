; RevM2 desktop installer hooks (referenced via bundle.windows.nsis.installerHooks
; in tauri.conf.json). Tauri's NSIS template calls these macros automatically
; at the right points - nothing else needs to invoke them.
;
; What this achieves, end to end:
;   1. Install requires one UAC prompt (installMode: perMachine already
;      forces this).
;   2. That elevated moment is used to create a Scheduled Task that
;      launches revm2-desktop.exe with RunLevel "highest" (i.e. admin
;      integrity), and to point the Start Menu / Desktop shortcuts at
;      that task instead of the exe directly.
;   3. Because the task's elevation was already consented to at install
;      time, running it later via `schtasks /run` does NOT prompt for
;      UAC again - this is standard, well-documented Windows Task
;      Scheduler behavior, not a workaround of anything.
;   4. The result: revm2-desktop.exe runs at High integrity on every
;      normal launch. A standard (non-elevated) Task Manager, run by
;      the same logged-in user, cannot terminate a High-integrity
;      process - Windows returns Access Denied. That's what actually
;      stops a casual "just End Task it" bypass, not anything the app
;      does at runtime.
;   5. Uninstall is gated on session.lock (written/removed by the app
;      itself in lib.rs's set_session_active) - if a session is active,
;      the uninstaller refuses and explains why.

!macro NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL
    ; --- ProgramData\RevM2 needs to be writable by standard users -----
    ; The app itself runs elevated (see below) so it could write here
    ; regardless, but keeping this permissive means the session.lock
    ; read in the uninstaller (running as a different, also-elevated
    ; process) never trips over an ACL surprise either way.

    ; /sc onlogon: also starts automatically at login, matching normal
    ; "study app opens with Windows" expectations.

    ; /f: overwrite if this task already exists (re-install/upgrade case).

    ; --- Redirect shortcuts to launch via the task, not the exe -------
    ; Tauri's base NSIS script already created these pointing straight
    ; at the exe; overwriting them here (same paths) makes every normal
    ; launch path - Start Menu, Desktop, taskbar pin - go through the
    ; elevated task instead. IconFile keeps the app's real icon even
    ; though the shortcut target is now schtasks.exe.
    ; Shortcuts from the pre-rename builds (named RevM2) would otherwise be
    ; left behind after an upgrade.
